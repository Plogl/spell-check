 Spell checker

-A test run of this code can be found as Spell-Checker-Example.gif-

Spellcheck that stores a dictionary as an unordered map, and displays all 
possible mispellings when it finds a word that isn't found in the dictionary.
Once a word is detected, it will try one of four methods, swapping adjacent
characters, deleting characters, adding a character, or swapping a character for
another one. If a correction is detected, it's added to a vector of suggested 
corrections, and once all methods have been attempted, the corrections are 
returned if any are found.

To run this program, put both SpellCheck.cpp and dictionary.txt in the same file. You can use any other txt named dictionary.txt as
your dictionary file. Compile and run SpellCheck.cpp.
